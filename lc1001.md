## 1001. Grid Illumination

On a N x N grid of cells, each cell (x, y) with 0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < N has a lamp.

Initially, some number of lamps are on.  lamps[i] tells us the location of the i-th lamp that is on.  Each lamp that is on illuminates every square on its x-axis, y-axis, and both diagonals (similar to a Queen in chess).

For the i-th query queries[i] = (x, y), the answer to the query is 1 if the cell (x, y) is illuminated, else 0.

After each query (x, y) [in the order given by queries], we turn off any lamps that are at cell (x, y) or are adjacent 8-directionally (ie., share a corner or edge with cell (x, y).)

Return an array of answers.  Each value answer[i] should be equal to the answer of the i-th query queries[i].

 
 
### Example
Input: N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: 
Before performing the first query we have both lamps [0,0] and [4,4] on.
The grid representing which cells are lit looks like this, where [0,0] is the top left corner, and [4,4] is the bottom right corner:
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Then the query at [1, 1] returns 1 because the cell is lit.  After this query, the lamp at [0, 0] turns off, and the grid now looks like this:
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
Before performing the second query we have only the lamp [4,4] on.  Now the query at [1,0] returns 0, because the cell is no longer lit.


### Idea
- Maintain hashmap.

```
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> r, c, d1, d2;
    vector<vector<int>> dir = {{-1,-1}, {-1,0}, {-1,1},
                               {0, -1}, {0, 0}, {0, 1},
                               {1, -1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}};
    void illuminate(int N, int x, int y){
        r[x].insert(y);
        c[y].insert(x);
        d1[x+y].insert(x);
        d2[x-y].insert(x);
    }
    void dilluminate(int N, int x, int y){
        for (auto i : dir) {
            int a = x + i[0], b = y + i[1];
            if (!(a < 0|| a >= N || b < 0|| b >= N)){
                r[a].erase(b);
                c[b].erase(a);
                d1[a+b].erase(a);
                d2[a-b].erase(a);   
            }
        }
    }
    void query(int N, int x, int y, vector<int>& res){
        (r[x].empty() && c[y].empty() && d1[x+y].empty() && d2[x-y].empty())?res.push_back(0):res.push_back(1);
        dilluminate(N, x, y);
    }
    vector<int> gridIllumination(int N, vector<vector<int>>& l, vector<vector<int>>& q) {
        vector<int> res;
        for(auto i : l) illuminate(N, i[0], i[1]);
        for(auto i : q) query(N, i[0], i[1], res);
        return res;
    }
};
```
