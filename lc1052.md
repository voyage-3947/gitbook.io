## 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner

Today, the bookstore owner has a store open for customers.length minutes.  Every minute, some number of customers (customers[i]) enter the store, and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy.  If the bookstore owner is grumpy on the i-th minute, grumpy[i] = 1, otherwise grumpy[i] = 0.  When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for X minutes straight, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

### Example:
Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], X = 3
Output: 16
Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes. 
The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.

### Idea:
2 vector dp, with use or not use the trick.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& c, vector<int>& g, int X) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(2,vector<int>(c.size(), 0));
        dp[0].back() = (g.back())?(0):(c.back());
        dp[1].back() = c.back();
        for(int i = c.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--){
            dp[0][i] = max(dp[0][i+1], dp[1][i+1]);
            if(g[i]==0) dp[0][i] += c[i];
            dp[1][i] = c[i] + dp[1][i+1];
            if(i+X < c.size() && g[i+X] == 1) dp[1][i] -= c[i+X];
        }
        return max(dp[0][0],dp[1][0]);
    }
};
```
